sigma.indexes.neighbors
=======================

Plugin by [Alexis Jacomy](https://github.com/jacomyal).

---

This plugin contains some basic indexes to write any graph traversal algorithm. It will keep updated during the lifecycle of the graph for each node references to its incoming, outgoing and undirected edges.

You can check the `sigma.plugins.neighborhoods` plugin to see how to use them.
